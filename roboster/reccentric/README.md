Facing issue while putting the server online , it wasn't working but surely there's a way .


## Installing

If the server is not running on any machine then ,
To get this running in your local machine follow the instruction:

1. Clone the repository in which it contains

2. Run the files in your local pc.


In the end ,  you have to search roboster or reccentricbot on telegram and start talking with your roboster.
